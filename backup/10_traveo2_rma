## Failure type

First step is to identify the failure type. They are either one of:

1. In the Field / End Customer.
2. During production at OEM / "0 km Failure"
3. During production at Tier 1

## Steps to be followed by Visteon in case of failure(s)

- Perform a swap test to identify if the failure moves with the microcontroller.
- Perform initial failure analysis.
- Create a failure report.
- Define a clear and comprehensive failure description.
- QA of TIER1 contacts regional quality partner at Infineon to hand over all [required information](#required-information).
- Infineon creates a new FA case in salesforce.com.
- TIER1 sends the sample to Infineon.
- Steps followed are described in Failure analysis procedure at Infineon.

## Pre-requisites

1. Device's Unique ID
2. Visteon's Private Key for the public key in the sflash.

## How to acquire pre-requisite

1. If Sys-DAP is available, these two special commands can be run via Sys-DAP.
2. The first command is to read the internal unique device ID, and the other is to invoke the transition to the RMA lifecycle stage.

Converts parts from SECURE or SECURE WITH DEBUG to the RMA life-cycle stage. This API returns the 0xF00000A9
failure code if any active embedded flash operations are going on. Note that TransitiontoRMA will consume an additional 2KB
of SRAM starting at address 0x28000800. For successful execution of the system call, read and write access for this area
should be provided for Protection Context 1 (PC1). Otherwise, the execution will fail and there will be no transition into the
RMA life-cycle stage. When using the TransitiontoRMA API, to move a device to the RMA life-cycle stage, parameters such
as certificate and digital signature must be placed from [SRAM0 start address + 4KB].
Note: Due to improper initialization of the Crypto memory buffer and internal SRAM0, Crypto and SRAM0 ECC errors may
occur after the TransitionToRMA SROM API call. The PERI_GROUP_VIO_2 fault may also get set. To avoid this issue, do not
configure the fault structure for Crypto, SRAM0 ECC errors, and PERI_GROUP_VIO_2 fault before triggering
TransitionToRMA, or ignore the ECC faults reported during TransitionToRMA execution.
