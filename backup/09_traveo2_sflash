## SFlash Architecture

### BOOT ROM

- Life cycle stage (NAR / SAR) settings
- Protection state settings
- Validates integrity of flash boot before starting it.

SLOW_WS[1:0] and FAST_WS[1:0] in the CPUSS_ROM_CLT register.

The programmable wait states represent the number of CLK_HF0 cycles for a read path through the SROM in either the fast or slow domain.

The application that changes CLK_HF0 must set the ROM wait states corresponding to the new target of CLK_HF0 frequency before CLK_HF0 is raised.

The wait states for the slow clock domain are:
CPUSS_ROM_CTL.SLOW_WS = ‘0’ for (CLK_HF0 ≤ 100 MHz)
CPUSS_ROM_CTL.SLOW_WS = ‘1’ for (CLK_HF0 > 100 MHz) and (CLK_HF0 ≤ CLK_HF0 Max)

The wait state for the fast clock domain is:
CPUSS_ROM_CTL.FAST_WS = ‘0’ up to CLK_HF0 Max

The protection state is determined on boot and defined by the value of the CPUSS_PROTECTION register.
